Set up of supply project

1. set up new connections within .pg_service.conf - Office and Field, e.g., 

#
[CS2509_Strands_Colindale_Office]
host=localhost
port={local port}
dbname=CS2509_Strands_Colindale
user=postgres
password={you local postgres password}
#
[CS2509_Strands_Colindale_Field]
host={IP address of field machine}
port={field machine port}
dbname=CS2509_Strands_Colindale
user={your user name on field machine}
password={your password on field machine}
#

2. Create database and restore most recent "template", e.g., TOMs_Test_240606.backup

3. Remove any test data - restrictionsWithGNSS\DATAMODEL\DemandSetup\0000_remove_test_data.sql

4. Copy the folder "..\restrictionsWithGNSS\QGIS\Project folder structure" to your working area and then rename the top level folder and project files in Office/Supply/Demand with the project name. Ensure that the OS mapping and the site area files are in the Office folder structure

5. Choose the appropriate TOMs.conf file in Demand

6. Change the connection details within the QGIS project files - Office, Supply, Demand - load and Demand. Open the project files in a text editor and then use Find/Replace to modify the connection details. ** will prepare a script to assist with this **

7. Open Office project and:
   a. Add relevant layers - from geopackage - TopographicArea, CartographicText; from ShapeFiles - Site Area; from db add RoadLink_2019
   b. Select features from RoadLink_2019 that intersect with SiteArea - Vector->Research Tools->Select by Location (use intersect as geometric predicate)
   c. Create new PostGIS connection within QGIS
   d. Import layers into database with Database->DB Manager then with the relevant PostGIS database connected, use "Import Layer/File" to add the following (tick "Replace destination table" and "Create spatial index"):
      - TopographicArea - topography/os_mastermap_topography_polygons
	  - CartographicText - topography/os_mastermap_topography_text
	  - project_code_SiteArea - local_authority/SiteArea
	  - RoadLink_2019 - highways_network/roadlink (import only selected features)
	  
8. Reopen Office project (without saving). Zoom to SiteArea and details should be showing. Save project at this point

9. In PgAdmin, run queries from restrictionsWithGNSS\DATAMODEL\DemandSetup:
 - 0001a_create_road_casement.sql (ensure that all required areas are included. Possibly need to use RC_Polygons)
 - 0001b_setup_roadlink.sql
 - 0001c1_setup_mapgrid.sql
 - 0001c2_convert_site_area_to_single_poly.sql
 - 0001d1_prepare_required_restriction_and_sign_types.sql
	* Check that all the necessary time periods are present, e.g., CPZs or SKCs
 - 0001e_permissions.sql

Reopen Office project

10. Within office project:
   a. add Corner points and SectionBreak points
   b. modify SiteArea so that it uses Corners/SectionBreaks
   
   c. Consider lengths of roads to ensure that they are no longer than 250m
    - 0001h_check_road_lengths.sql
   d. Break roads at site boundary and rename to avoid issue with stress preparation
    - 0001i_break_roads_at_site_boundaries.sql
   e. Check that the road centreline is within the road area
   
11. In pgAdmin, create sections:
 - 0002a_create_sections.sql (added sections_merged queries here)
 - 0002c_project_parameters.sql (consider the vehicle length and corner protection distances)
 - 0002e_topo_mask.sql
 - 0002d_permissions.sql
 
12. Check RC_Sections_merged to ensure that breaks match road names
 - Update symbology in RC_Sections_merged (Delete All / Classify)
 - Check for breaks and add/move as required
 - Add/Amend road centrelines as required 
 
13. Backup database - and load into field machine

14. Ensure that CrossingPoint is able to save - 0001f_crossing_points_field_fix.sql

15. Check field project loads correctly - and that it is possible to create all the restriction types - bays, lines, signs and crossing points

--- **** After field survey

1. Backup field database - including crossing points 

2. Rename orginal database

3. Create new database with the same name as previous and restore details from field db. This means that the connection details remain the same.

4.Deal with any time periods that were missed. Add into "TimePeriodsInUse" and then refresh (with data) the materialised view "TimePeriodsInUse_View" 

5a. Use Snap/Trace plugin for Bays/Lines
  a. Snap. Remove duplicate points; Snap nodes together; Snap vertices to kerbline. Start with tolerance of 0.5. Increae as appropriate - but only use Snap vertices to Kerbline
  b. Trace kerbline. Should be OK with 0.5m

5b. Use Snap/Trace plugin for CrossingPoints. (Use CrossingPoints in both Bays and Lines)
  a. Snap. Remove duplicate points; Snap vertices to kerbline. Start with tolerance of 0.5. Increae as appropriate - but only use Snap vertices to Kerbline
  b. Trace kerbline. Should be OK with 0.5m
  
6. Amend site area to include any complete features - specifically CrossingPoints

7. Run scripts
  - 0003a1_create_supply_table.sql
  - 0003a2_populate_supply_table_with_bays_lines.sql (if using restrictions)
  - 0003b_copy_supply.sql
  - 0004a1a0_add_corner_and_section_break_points.sql
  - 0004a1b_break_at_corners.sql (Will need to reopen project to check if issues)
  - 0004a2_corner_unacceptability.sql
  - 0004b_break_restrictions_at_crossovers.sql (Will need to reopen project to check if issues)
  - 0004c_narrow_roads.sql
  - 0004d_check_overlaps.sql (Will need to reopen project to check if issues)
  - 0004e_dual_restrictions.sql
  - 0005a_finalise_supply_details.sql
  - 0005a1_set_trigger_for_project_parameters.sql
  - 0005b1_add_survey_areas and populate.sql
  - 0005e_site.sql
  - 0005f_amend_labelling_function.sql

8. Reopen project

9. Recalculate AzToRoadCentreLine. Open Supply layer. In edit mode, update AzimmuthToRoadCentreLine using TOMs2 function  getAzimuthToRoadCentreLine() 
 
10. Check Geometry Shape for Crossings

11. Check acceptability on Road width, Bus/Cycle lanes, etc

11a. Check all restrictions have a RoadName

12. Remove any supply that is outside the site area

13. In layer "Site", add the boundary of the site being considered

-- **** Now prepare the demand project ...

14. Run scripts in demandForm
 - 0007a_demand_lookups_structure.sql
 - 0007b_demand_lookups_data.sql
 - 0007c_surveys.sql
 
15. Use 0007d2_CreateSurveyList.xlsx to create Surveys

16. Run scripts
  - 0007d_surveys_data.sql
  - 0008a2_generate_count_table.sql (or VRMs if required)
  - 0008b_RestrictionsInSurveys.sql
  - 0009_create_unique_fields_for_QGIS_counts.sql
  
17. Set up SYL/ZigZag control times using TimePeriodsControlledDuringSurveyHours plugin
   - Create table - use script in TimePeriodsControlledDuringSurveyHours plugin (..\TimePeriodsControlledDuringSurveyHours\DATAMODEL\0001_controlled_surveys.sql)
   - Reopen Office project
   - within Office project, run TimePeriodsControlledDuringSurveyHours plugin
   - Manually selected true/false 
  
18. Open Load project and create geopackages using Processing->Toolbox->Package Layers and add layers as per details in 0008d_next_steps.txt

19. Test demand project ...
